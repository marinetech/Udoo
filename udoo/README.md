THEMO Signal package

Python tools that lets the user generate waveforms and write them to a file too be sent over the channel through the projectors.
In order to run teh linraries the user needs to install the scipy python package.

The experiment scripts are written in Python which is both powerful and simple, anyway an example is available in the main folder.

Different signals are avialable and they can be combined to obtain the desired sequence. To add more waveforms or functionalities please contact the maintainers.
