THEMO Signal package
====================

Python library that lets the user generate waveforms and write them to a file to be sent over the channel through the projectors.
In order to run the libraries, the user needs to install the scipy and matplotlib Python packages.

`apt-get install scipy python-matplotlib`

accepting the dependencies, also numpy and scipy will be installed.

The experiment scripts are written in Python which is both powerful and simple, anyway an example is available in the main folder.

Different signals are available and they can be combined to obtain the desired sequence. To add more waveforms or functionalities please contact the maintainers.
